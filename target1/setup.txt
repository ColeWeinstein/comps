Notes on setting up the ManicMeese VM.

1) Downloaded a Ubuntu Live Server .iso from https://ubuntu.com/download/server. Created a new VM
with this .iso and followed the setup instructions.

1.1) In VMware, clicked "Create a New Virtual Machine", clicked "Next" twice, then for "Install
from" selected "Installer disc image file (iso)" and selected the path to the downloaded .iso file.
Then, clicked "Next", named the VM, selected where to store it, and clicked "Next" until I finished
setting up the VM.

1.2) When setting up the Ubuntu server VM, selected all of the default settings, except when asked
if I wanted to install OpenSSH. Here, selected that I wanted to install OpenSSH (default is not to).

2) Installed Apache2 (newest version - 2.4.52). Created a new index.html with some moose-related
content. (Apache2 web server was automatically configured to run at startup and at port 80.)

2.1) Edited "/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml" to include the following instructions, in order
to allow the VM to connect to the network interfaces used by both VMware and UTM:

	ens33:
	  dhcp4: true
	enp0s1:
	  dhcp4: true

3) Setup an account "webmaster" used to manage the webserver. Chown "var/www/html" and its contents
to be owned by webmaster. Also, added the code below to the section of "/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"
that "Sets the default security model of the Apache2 HTTPD server", in order to make the webmaster
home directory accessible by the webserver (at the alias "/web/").
	
	Alias "/web" "/home/webmaster"
	<Directory /home/webmaster>
		Options Indexes
		AllowOverride None
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

3.1) Made "/", "/home", and "/home/webmaster" world executable, so that the Apache webserver could
access the webmaster home directory.

4) Created a directory "images/" in webmaster's home directory to store images for the webserver.
Added some secret txt files :)

5) Created an SSH key pairs using the ssh-keygen command. The keys were automatically placed into
".ssh/" within the "webmaster/" home directory. Added the entire contents of the public key to
".ssh/authorized_keys" to allow users to ssh into the machine as webmaster.

6) Made everything in "webmaster/" world readable, recursively (via "chmod -r a+x ."). Made the
subdirectories in "webmaster/" world executable, again so that the Apache webserver can access them.
