Notes on setting up the ManicMeese VM.

1) Downloaded a Ubuntu Live Server .iso from https://ubuntu.com/download/server. Created a new VM
with this .iso and followed the setup instructions.

1.1) In VMware, click "Create a New Virtual Machine", click "Next" twice, then for "Install from"
select "Installer disc image file (iso)" and select the path to the downloaded .iso file. Then,
click "Next", name the VM, select where you want to store it, and click "Next" until you finish
setting up the VM.

1.2) When setting up the Ubuntu server VM, select all of the default settings, except when asked if
you want to install OpenSSH. Here, select that you want to install OpenSSH (default is not to).

2) Installed Apache2 (newest version - 2.4.??). Created a new index.html with some moose-related
content. (Apache2 web server was automatically configured to run at startup and at port 80.)

3) Setup an account "webmaster" used to manage the webserver. Chown var/www/html and its contents
to be owned by webmaster. Also, added the following code to the section of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
that "Sets the default security model of the Apache2 HTTPD server", in order to make the webmaster
home directory accessible by the webserver (at the alias "/web/").
	
	Alias "/web" "/home/webmaster"
	<Directory /home/webmaster>
		Options Indexes
		AllowOverride None
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

3.1) Make "/", "/home", and "/home/webmaster" world executable, so that the Apache webserver can
access the webmaster home directory.

4) Created a directory "images/" in webmaster's home directory to store images for the webserver.
Added some secret txt files :)

5) Created an SSH key pairs using the ssh-keygen command. The keys were automatically placed into
".ssh/" within the "webmaster/" home directory. Added the entire contents of the public key to
".ssh/authorized_keys" to allow users to ssh into the machine as webmaster.

6) Make everything in "webmaster/" world readable, recursively (chmod -r a+x .). Make the
subdirectories in "webmaster/" world executable, again so that the Apache webserver can access them.
